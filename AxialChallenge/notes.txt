<ecmabot> roadrunneratwast: Using ".onclick", ".onchange", or "on" anything is bad practice and results in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code; as well as limiting you to one event listener per event. Consider attaching your events with addEventListener, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener

<falafel> roadrunneratwast, but otherwise looks ok to me, although very imperative, JS has lots of builtin things that would make your code half the size easily
<ezakimak> you might refactor all your button clicks, you have 2 function each repeated 3 times

<roadrunneratwast> what sort of builtin things?

<roadrunneratwast> like map
<roadrunneratwast> yeah
<roadrunneratwast> okay

<ezakimak> in fact, you could refactor all of your button code, controlled by simple data with name and dimension or name and difficulty
